OwnProp is solving these problems by using blockchain technology to reduce overhead costs, increase transparency, and speed up the settlement of transactions. OwnProp’s tokenized investment opportunities include iconic properties that provide predictable appreciation as well as cash flow. The OwnProp platform is currently available to accredited investors as we work towards opening up to retail investors in summer of 2023.",
